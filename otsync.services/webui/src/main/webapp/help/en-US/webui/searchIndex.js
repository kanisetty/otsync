External users can only access content in shared folders. They cannot add content outside of a shared folder. Also, External users cannot publish items from their Tempo Box folder to Content Server or otherwise access Content Server .

When you share a folder, you grant read/write or read-only permission to other users as potential collaborators who can also access the folder. The collaborator must accept the share request before they can access the files in the share folder.¶Read/write access gives collaborators full control over the contents of the shared folder, which includes the ability to add, edit, copy, move, rename, and delete items and folders in the shared folder.¶Read-only access allows collaborators to view and copy the items in a shared folder. Read-only collaborators cannot edit, move, or delete items. If a read-only collaborator adds an item, the item is not synced to other collaborators. When a collaborator has read-only access to a folder, the lock overlay appears.

A red notification¶appears in the top pane when you have pending sharing invitations. Once accepted, the shared folder is placed in the root of your Tempo Box folder where the folder name is appended with the user name of the folder owner. For example,¶Marketing Materials (jsmith)¶.

If you have this ability, you must provide the External user’s email address when sharing a folder. The External user then receives an email, inviting them to register for an OpenText Tempo Box account. After registering, the External user can install clients and access OpenText Tempo Box just like Content Server users, with the following exceptions:¶External users cannot share folders.¶External users cannot add files or folders outside of a share folder.¶External users cannot publish items to or otherwise access Content Server .¶For more information on External users, see¶.¶Sharing Enterprise Objects¶¶You can share Enterprise objects with other Content Server users if the following conditions are met:¶In the¶Content Server Administration¶page, Content Server integration is enabled and the Enterprise objects that you want to share are specified.¶In the Content Server Enterprise Workspace, the Enterprise object that you want to share allows subscriptions.¶You have¶Edit Permissions¶permission for the Enterprise object.

This is the only way in which Standard users can access the content in an Enterprise object.¶Sharing Enterprise Objects with External Users¶¶In order to share Enterprise objects with External users, your administrator must enable external sharing and choose the Content Server users with whom they would like to grant external sharing privileges. Contact your administrator to complete these conditions.
