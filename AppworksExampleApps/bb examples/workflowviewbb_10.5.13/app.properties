# * All other properties will be treated as app settings with key <appname>.<setting>
# * Defining at least one of these properties will create a setting:
# * <setting>.type (string, integer, bool; default string)
# * <setting>.displayName (default <setting>)
# * <setting>.description (default <appname> <setting>)
# * <setting>.default (default "", 0, or false)
# *
# * If this is an update, type cannot be changed.
# * The current value of the setting will be updated to the new default if the setting has not been modified.
